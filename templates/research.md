# Research Template

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md` - comprehensive ecosystem research before planning.

**Purpose:** Document what Claude needs to know to implement a phase well - not just "which library" but "how do experts build this."

---

## File Template

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Research

**Researched:** [date]
**Domain:** [primary technology/problem domain]
**Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

<user_constraints>
## User Constraints (from CONTEXT.md)

**CRITICAL:** If CONTEXT.md exists from /team:discuss-phase, copy locked decisions here verbatim. These MUST be honored by the planner.

### Locked Decisions
[Copy from CONTEXT.md `## Decisions` section - these are NON-NEGOTIABLE]
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

### Claude's Discretion
[Copy from CONTEXT.md - areas where researcher/planner can choose]
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]

### Deferred Ideas (OUT OF SCOPE)
[Copy from CONTEXT.md - do NOT research or plan these]
- [Deferred 1]
- [Deferred 2]

**If no CONTEXT.md exists:** Write "No user constraints - all decisions at Claude's discretion"
</user_constraints>

<research_summary>
## Summary

[2-3 paragraph executive summary]
- What was researched
- What the standard approach is
- Key recommendations

**Primary recommendation:** [one-liner actionable guidance]
</research_summary>

<standard_stack>
## Standard Stack

The established libraries/tools for this domain:

### Core
| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [why experts use it] |
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [why experts use it] |

### Supporting
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [use case] |
| [name] | [ver] | [what it does] | [use case] |

### Alternatives Considered
| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| [standard] | [alternative] | [when alternative makes sense] |

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install [packages]
# or
yarn add [packages]
```

<dont_hand_roll>
## Don't Hand-Roll

Problems that look simple but have existing solutions:

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |
| [problem] | [what you'd build] | [library] | [edge cases, complexity] |

**Key insight:** [why custom solutions are worse in this domain]

## Guidelines

**When to create:**
- Before planning phases in niche/complex domains
- When Claude's training data is likely stale or sparse
- When "how do experts do this" matters more than "which library"

**Structure:**
- Use XML tags for section markers (matches Agent Teams templates)
- Seven core sections: summary, standard_stack, architecture_patterns, dont_hand_roll, common_pitfalls, code_examples, sources
- All sections required (drives comprehensive research)

**Content quality:**
- Standard stack: Specific versions, not just names
- Architecture: Include actual code examples from authoritative sources
- Don't hand-roll: Be explicit about what problems to NOT solve yourself
- Pitfalls: Include warning signs, not just "don't do this"
- Sources: Mark confidence levels honestly

**Integration with planning:**
- RESEARCH.md loaded as @context reference in PLAN.md
- Standard stack informs library choices
- Don't hand-roll prevents custom solutions
- Pitfalls inform verification criteria
- Code examples can be referenced in task actions

**After creation:**
- File lives in phase directory: `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`
- Referenced during planning workflow
- plan-phase loads it automatically when present
